# AGENTS.md — Alkemos AI Agent Operating System

> **Status:** Active — binding on every AI agent (and human contributor) before any commit, PR, or production change.
> **Reading scope (Phase 292 — ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit P3-2):** the SESSION read is §1–§4 + §12 (with STATE.md + the top-3 worklog entries — the budget in `docs/README.md`); §5–§11 are binding law read ON DEMAND when their scope is touched; §8's full narratives (incidents, decisions, history) live in `docs/TECH_REFERENCE.md` §6.
> **Last updated:** 2026-09-30 (REPAIR-OBSERVABILITY-R5 — the repair loop is now MEASURABLE: every directive stamps a `repairLoop` bundle marker, the run Summary prints the cycle count, and /api/ai/queue-health carries the 14-day «repair-first vs regenerate» counter; no gate or budget changed. Previously 2026-09-30 FLOOR-ALIGNMENT-R4.)

## 1. Purpose

Operating rules for AI agents on Alkemos: the repo is **private** (owner decision 2026-09-24 — it was public before; history retains the public era, and the code is still treated as leakable), **proprietary** as a product, **production-deployed** (real customers, payments, PII) and **agent-assisted**. Agents are implementers and reviewers — never autonomous product owners: they execute well-scoped tasks, document the work, and hand control back to a human supervisor.

---

## 2. Roles

| Role | Who | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Owner / Human Supervisor** | `muscleshubfit@gmail.com` (Ahmed) | Final say on every change. Approves features, fixes, schema, security, deploys. |
| **Technical Reviewer** | Any AI assistant the Owner designates for the active session. | Reviews proposals, drafts task commands, flags risks. Does NOT commit code directly. |
| **Implementation Agent** | GML (this agent) + any sub-agent it delegates to. | Writes code, runs tests, updates docs, pushes commits — every change reviewed/approved by the human supervisor. |

The owner may designate additional agents or reviewers; until then the table above is authoritative.

## 3. Operating Rules (Binding on All Agents)

### 3.1 Inspect Before Modifying

Read the actual source, config, and migrations before changing anything — docs can lag (hierarchy: §12.8); on conflict verify the code and document the discrepancy in `worklog.md`. Quote file paths + line numbers in commits and reports so the human reviewer can verify.

### 3.2 Do Not Expose Secrets

Never commit or paste credentials anywhere (code, comments, fixtures, docs, chat, server logs — Vercel logs leak). New env vars go into `.env.example` EMPTY + documented in `SECURITY.md`. Suspected leak → STOP, alert the owner, do NOT push.

### 3.3 Do Not Modify Production Data

No agent-run `DELETE` / `UPDATE` / `TRUNCATE` / `DROP` on production Supabase; read-only verification queries (e.g. `SELECT count(*) FROM blog_posts`) allowed when necessary. Data migrations ship as idempotent SQL files under `supabase/migrations/` and are applied to production AUTOMATICALLY by the Supabase–GitHub integration when the commit lands on `main` (Phase 120 law correction, owner directive 2026-09-05 — the Supabase project is LINKED to the repo; auto-apply proven since Phase 61, migrations 0060→0069) — the owner runs SQL by hand ONLY on the documented manual path (§6: the `auth.users` exception 0040/0050/0055/0066 + legacy `RUN_ON_SUPABASE_*`/`VERIFY_*` files).

### 3.4 Do Not Invent Architecture

No precedent in the codebase → propose the design in plain prose FIRST, get owner/reviewer sign-off, only then implement. Never introduce a new state/ORM/auth/payment/AI/deployment stack without explicit owner approval — the stack is documented in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`; stay inside it.

### 3.5 Verify Changes

> **Canonical command set — do NOT duplicate these commands elsewhere.**
> §4 (Definition of Done) and `archive/QA_CHECKLIST.md` (Verification Protocol —
> frozen at Phase 115)
> MUST reference this section by pointer instead of restating the commands.

The canonical verification command set:

```bash
# 1. TypeScript — must report 0 errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. ESLint — must report 0 errors (warnings are acceptable if pre-existing)
npx eslint .

# 3. Next.js build — must exit 0 (run when changes touch rendering,
#    routes, or anything that could break the build)
npx next build

# 4. Git push — forward-only (never `--force` without explicit Owner directive)
git push origin main

# 5. Sync verification — both must be identical
git fetch origin --quiet
[ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" ] && echo "SYNCED" || echo "DRIFT"

# 6. Working tree clean check
git status --short
# Expected: empty (or only pre-existing drift)
```

**Scope-matched verification (Phase 290 — ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit P2-2 — codifies the Phase-223/283 precedent):** the battery is scoped to what the frame actually touches. A **docs-only frame** (only `**.md` · `docs/**` · `archive/**` · `.github/**` · `scripts/**` — zero `src/`/`supabase/`/build-config change) runs ONLY the static docs gates locally — `python3 scripts/docs_parity.py` + `python3 scripts/docs_audit.py` (+ `python3 scripts/migration_audit.py` and the two guard scripts when touching their scope) — NOT tsc/eslint/vitest/build: a change that cannot alter a test outcome does not pay the code battery (CI mirrors this via `quality-gate.yml` `paths-ignore`). A frame touching `src/**`, `supabase/**`, or build config runs the FULL set above. Claiming PASS outside the matching scope is a §4 violation.

Additional rules: smoke-test touched API routes locally with `curl` before claiming success; "it compiles" is not "it works" — functional verification > smoke test > type check.

### 3.6 Session Protocol — STATE.md First (Owner directive 2026-09-03 — approved study «المنظومة المعرفية للمشروع كلها»)

Every session opens with: (0) read `STATE.md` — the official always-current state (~30 s); (1) `git fetch origin --quiet` + last 3 `worklog.md` entries + last 5 commit subjects; (2) trust NO number in ANY doc — take it from its single source (the map in `STATE.md`); (3) survival law — the workspace is EPHEMERAL, so any knowledge that must live is committed & pushed in the SAME session. End-of-task duty: `STATE.md` is refreshed in the same phase/commit that changes the state it describes — a stale STATE.md is an INCOMPLETE change (same severity as §3.8).

### 3.7 Always Verify Against `origin/main` Before Any Decision or Report

The local clone and conversation memory are NOT sources of truth. Before any state claim, new task, audit, or refusal: `git fetch origin --quiet` and confirm HEAD == `origin/main`; behind → `git pull --ff-only` (or cite `git show origin/main:<path>`); ahead/dirty → surface to the Owner, never `reset --hard` / `push --force` / `checkout -- .` without explicit instruction. Runtime claims ("X is live", "Y returns 200") require verification against the production URL or a verifiable recent record — memory is not evidence.

### 3.8 Documentation Parity Law (Owner directive 2026-09-02 — «دايماً عدل التوثيقات وملفات هيكل المشروع علشان ميحصلش لغبطة» + Phase 107 single-source extension)

Every code change ships its docs in the SAME phase — never "later". Minimum per phase (append-only, newest on top): `worklog.md` entry · `STATE.md` refresh (§3.6 duty — since Phase 115, owner directive «الأمر الخامس», STATE.md is the SINGLE living status file: المرحلة + المفتوح + الممنوعات + ملخص جودة المرحلة; `PROGRESS.md`/`QA_CHECKLIST.md` were merged into it and FROZEN verbatim in `archive/`) — plus every file describing the changed behavior (`README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the `build-info` `aiTopology` label). **FEATURE README LAW (owner directive 2026-09-05):** any NEW feature, or any important modification of an existing feature, MUST be documented in `README.md` in the SAME phase — what it does, where it lives, how to use it; a feature missing from README is an INCOMPLETE change. **Single-source number law:** README/DEVELOPER_GUIDE carry ZERO variable counts — numbers live in the code or `supabase/migrations/INDEX.md`; `scripts/docs_audit.py` fails the push on any count there, on duplicate section numbers in this file, and on STATE consistency (phase + required sections + QA summary). Wrong-but-confident docs are worse than missing docs — fix or delete; dead code and stale references are deleted in the same phase (git preserves). Docs-only changes are allowed; commit starts with `docs:`. Obsolete sections move to `archive/` (append-only) or carry a `> **Deprecated (date):** reason` marker; resurrecting `PROGRESS.md`/`QA_CHECKLIST.md` at the root is gated (docs_audit F).

---

## 4. Definition of Done

A task is "Done" only when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Code written, formatted, committed with a clear message.
- [ ] §3.5 command set executed — all checks pass, no new errors/warnings beyond pre-existing.
- [ ] Affected routes/pages smoke-tested locally.
- [ ] Documentation updated (§3.8 minimum set + every file describing the changed behavior).
- [ ] `STATE.md` refreshed when phase / open items / prohibitions changed.
- [ ] `worklog.md` gained a new entry per §12.5.1.
- [ ] No secrets, no customer data, no production-only config committed.
- [ ] Change pushed and the human supervisor notified for deployment.
- [ ] Final report (§12.9) filed.

"Do not claim PASS unless the acceptance criteria are actually met." — non-negotiable.

---

## 5. Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

> **Deprecated (2026-08-24):** Superseded by §12.8. Do not use this hierarchy.

---

## 6. Rules for Database / Schema Changes

Every schema change = numbered migration under `supabase/migrations/` with the timestamped name `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_NNNN_<slug>.sql` — **idempotent** (`IF NOT EXISTS`), **RLS policies for any new table in the same file**, applied to production AUTOMATICALLY by the Supabase–GitHub integration when the commit lands on `main` (Phase 120 correction, owner directive 2026-09-05 — Supabase LINKED to GitHub; the Supabase Preview gate stops a failing migration BEFORE production), NEVER renamed after landing (Phase 61 incident); the agent still NEVER applies SQL to production itself. The ONLY manual path is the `auth.users` exception (0040/0050/0055/0066 — an auto-migration failing on integration-role auth privileges would block the whole pipeline: the 0054 lesson) plus legacy `RUN_ON_SUPABASE_*`/`VERIFY_*` files; those manual-SQL deliveries MUST attach the RAW GitHub link of a ready-to-run file plus ONE consolidated `RUN_ON_SUPABASE_<IDs>.sql` (closing `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` + VERIFY block) — describing manual SQL without the runnable file + raw link is an INVALID delivery. **MIGRATION INDEX LAW:** every new migration adds its row to `supabase/migrations/INDEX.md` and regenerates `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` in the same commit; `python3 scripts/migration_audit.py` must report no NEW drift before push. Full migration law + per-table rules + storage: [`docs/TECH_REFERENCE.md`](docs/TECH_REFERENCE.md) §1.2–§1.5.

---

## 7. Rules for Security-Sensitive Changes

Explicit human approval BEFORE implementation (not just after) for: auth (`auth-server.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `auth/*`) · RLS policies · payment logic (`api/tools/*`, `subscription_requests`, receipts, coach approval) · AI key handling (`ai-provider.ts`, AI Settings) · cookies/sessions/OAuth callbacks · CORS/CSP/HSTS or any `vercel.json` header · PII processing · any new external HTTP call. Process: prose proposal → human review (§2) → implement → `tsc`/lint/smoke → `SECURITY.md` updated → commit prefix `security:`.

---

## 8. Rules for AI Functionality Changes

> **Slimmed twice:** Phase 113 (owner «الأمر الثالث») · Phase 292 (ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit P3-2): every law keeps its name + binding core only — the full narratives (incidents, decisions, chronology) live verbatim in `docs/TECH_REFERENCE.md` §6; on any conflict the summary below governs and §12.8 (code wins) sits above both.

- **PROVIDER LAYER:** `src/lib/ai-provider.ts` is the SINGLE source of AI calls — providers OpenRouter + Groq + NVIDIA NIM ONLY. Two intentional paths — `callFreeAIFallbackChain()` (sequential strongest-first, budget-clamped ≤52s) and `callFreeOpenRouterRace()` (parallel fastest-wins, swap only) — never collapse or bypass them; consumers never fetch provider URLs themselves; scheduled/batch AI follows the native-GHA pattern (`scripts/blog-runner/run-step.mts`), never new Vercel-capped endpoints.
- **BLOG PIPELINE v3 + BILINGUAL PAIRING (Phase 157):** six phases p0→p5 under `/api/cron/blog/` with REQUIRED `?lang=en|ar`; one queue row = ONE article in ONE language; 1 slot/day/language (EN 22:00 UTC · AR 05:00 UTC); the ONE daily topic yields TWO rows sharing `pair_id` + sealed `sharedBrief` (adopt ≤72h · join ≤48h — widened from 48h/30h by AUDIT §9-2.5, 2026-09-29, after the live diagnosis showed the binding constraint was the pairing CALL, not the windows; the call now retries once with a deeper model walk, and queue-health surfaces the 7-day adoption rate); each language runs its FULL pipeline from scratch (never translation), P5 fills `linked_post_id` bidirectionally; ANY pairing failure degrades to legacy independent-row behavior.
- **ai_jobs TOPOLOGY:** every batch AI call is an `ai_jobs` row (0024) processed natively by `process-ai-jobs.yml` every 10 min via `scripts/ai-jobs-runner/process.mts`; the ONLY direct-model exception is EVO chat; Vercel routes may ENQUEUE but NEVER call a model; new AI feature = new job_type + processor entry + JOB_GATE row; browser = SELECT-own-row RLS only, writes service-role exclusive.
- **PROVIDER BALANCE + DUAL-KEY POOL:** the chain rotates the leading provider per call across ALL THREE providers, rotates BOTH OpenRouter accounts round-robin, retries the SAME model on the other account on 401/402/403/429 before falling down the ladder; `callAIWithFallback` stays EXACT (one config → one provider, honest errors — never a silent cross-provider stage); Groq oversized-payload guard is PER-ENTRY (R3, Execution-Path Audit 2026-09-29): when a call's est. size exceeds the 7.2k window, a groq entry's max_tokens is clamped to the remaining window and the entry STAYS in the chain while the clamp keeps ≥3800 output tokens (P2 content re-enters Groq at ~4.8–4.9k max_tokens — the platform's best live survivor, previously evicted from exactly the heaviest calls); below the floor the entry is dropped as before (P4 review stays OpenRouter/NVIDIA-only BY DESIGN). Rollback: `GROQ_MAX_TOKENS_CLAMP=0` restores the pre-R3 global drop verbatim. Canaries: `ai-provider-r3-groq-clamp.test.ts` (P2/P4 payload classes, floor boundary, rollback flag, fast-chain exemption, small-payload no-op).
- **UNIVERSAL MODEL SWITCHER COVERAGE:** every AI subsystem rides the chain with an observational `tag` (subsystem+provider+model+key event); a bare provider fetch outside the chain is banned; new consumers import from `ai-provider.ts` AND register their tag.
- **IMAGE SAFETY v1/v2 (SUPERSEDED):** the retired negation-suffix constant is BANNED by guard-stale-refs; canaries replay the incident prompts.
- **IMAGE SOURCE LAW v3 — PEXELS-FIRST (current):** AI image generation RETIRED; every blog image is REAL stock photography (Pexels primary, Unsplash/Pixabay failover, Pixabay safesearch=true); normal people allowed, nudity/immodesty NOT — `sanitizeImageQuery()` strips NSFW (EN+AR) + negations, `hasNsfwVocabulary()` screens every alt-text; delivery via Pexels src.landscape + next/image WebP; deterministic rotation per `variationKey`; FAIL-FAST without the key.
- **BLOG BODY IMAGE RENDER LAW:** `renderMarkdown()` converts `![alt](url)` → lazy `<img>` BEFORE the link rule; unsafe schemes dropped — guarded by `blog-markdown-images.test.ts`.
- **EVO CHAT SURFACE & HISTORY LAW:** the floating widget is the ONLY EVO chat surface (`/chat` permanently redirects; CTAs open it via `openEvoFloatingChat()`); back-button CLOSES the drawer; assistant links persist INSIDE `body` markdown and render as anchors; persistence is hydration-gated (empty mount-time write must never wipe history); reopening lands on the LATEST message; system prompt carries a hard capability whitelist, answers render plain text only; floating icon ≥48px.
- **EVO-5 CACHE / EVAL / ANALYTICS LAW:** the frequent-question cache (0081, pg_trgm — NO embeddings, NO 4th provider) serves ONLY context-free requests via the pure gate `isCacheEligibleMessage`; a cache-served message KEEPS consuming quota and the cache is fail-open; the system prompt lives in `evo-system-prompt.ts` (single source — `buildSystemPrompt` may never be forked); weekly eval judges the AR/EN reference set into `evo_eval_runs` (zero scored → RED, honest); every model dispatch writes `evo_call_stats`.
- **EVO-6 PARTNER API — REMOVED (owner order 2026-09-10):** do NOT resurrect any partner API/embed surface without a new owner order (retired identifiers banned by guard-stale-refs; 0083 dropped the tables; `EVO_PARTNER_API_ENABLED` is dead config); `evo-cache-server.ts` SURVIVES as the platform chat route's cache module.
- **AI SURFACE DEEP-AUDIT LAW:** every UI control calling an API must target an existing route (CI: `check-ui-wiring.sh`); uploads go through `POST /api/upload` + `GET /api/file` only; AppLayout `coachExtraLinks` lists EVERY `/admin/*` page for isAdmin only; re-audit after ANY new button+endpoint pair.
- **ROLE MODEL v2 LAW (0029+):** `profiles.role` = `client | coach | admin`; STAFF = coach ∪ admin; `is_coach()` = `role IN ('coach','admin')` — NEVER rewrite policies back to `= 'coach'` only; client-data RLS uses `is_coach_over()`; `/admin/*` is admin-exclusive; client surfaces staff-blocked; staff bypass consumer quotas; promotion via the `coach_emails` allowlist (never downgrades an admin) or manual SQL; `coach_assignments` is the 1:1 source of truth.
- **COACH ACTIVATION + OFFLINE PAYMENTS (0034+):** the coach collects OUTSIDE the site and the site RECORDS it (`coach_payments`) — never touches that money; `extend_subscription()` is guarded (service role / admin / assigned coach); `/api/coach/subscriptions/activate` verifies assignment + role, activates tier 'coaching' ONLY, debits the wallet atomically BEFORE extending (402 `insufficient_wallet`; admins wallet-exempt), refunds on failure; PLAN-BALANCE QUOTA: one unified monthly pool (`ai_plan_usage`, 0085, success-only — nutrition + workout COMBINED: free 2 · premium 4 · pro 8 · coaching 8; guests keyed by hashed browser id); editing + manual uploads UNLIMITED.
- **COACH WALLET LAW (0035+):** `coach_adjust_wallet()` is the ONLY wallet writer (SECURITY DEFINER, row-locked, never negative); top-ups: manual receipt review OR PayPal automated (purpose `wallet_topup`, USD 1:1, deterministic UUID5 — replays idempotent; webhook LOG-ONLY, never credits); quota counts the CURRENT UTC calendar month; self-registration PUBLIC (rate-limited + honeypot; role granted server-side only — 0036).
- **COACH BOOST PACKAGE (0037+):** per-client fees are PACKAGE-based (single debit calculator in coach-limits.ts); coach ads by ATOMIC wallet debit; public profile via the coach-public bucket; coach-only support at `/coach/help`; the WhatsApp share target is REMOVED by decree; the coach's WhatsApp number is served ONLY via `/api/my/coach-whatsapp` (ACTIVE subscription + assignment, never public, never a share target); affiliate commission EXCLUDED for coach-assigned clients (both choke points).
- **COACH CLIENT BOUNDARY + TERMINOLOGY LAW:** SITE COACHING (B2C, admin-reviewed only — 0043) vs COACH SYSTEM (B2B, wallet fee) are TWO money worlds; coaches never see site memberships (0041) and never generate plans without an ACTIVE coaching subscription + assignment (server 402 + DB RLS `plans_insert_coach`); dates are NEVER hand-edited — `extend_subscription` (0018) computes/stacks; coaching prices Starter $20 / Elite $40 (0046); subscription rows always via `canonicalModelTier()`.
- **GLOBAL USD LAW (0038):** fixed owner rate 50 EGP = $1 — every platform-side money figure is USD ONLY (source: `coach-limits.ts`; legacy EGP ÷50 for compat); user-facing money strings never show EGP/ج.م.
- **BRAND NAME LAW:** the site name is written EXACTLY «Alkemos» in every user-visible string; pre-rebrand spellings («Musclehubeg» + variants) are FORBIDDEN in new code; lowercase technical identifiers stay as-is forever.
- **USAGE LIMIT ENFORCEMENT LAW:** every limit advertised in `memberships.ts` MUST be enforced SERVER-SIDE at the only consuming route, and the client UI mirrors the SAME resolved tier; anonymous chat throttled SERVER-SIDE via salted-hash `evo_anon_usage` (fail-open); plan intents consume the UNIFIED monthly pool (success-only); swap/regenerate stays on the WEEKLY quota — never double-count one message in both; advertised numbers change ONLY in memberships.ts.
- **SCHEDULE HEALTH LAW:** any "blog stopped" report starts with schedule forensics (`GET /actions/runs?event=schedule`), NOT code re-reading; backstop `/api/cron/dispatch-pipelines` (CRON_SECRET, fail-closed, daily 23:40 UTC; slot expected 90 min after its hour; coverage = max(non-failed runs, posts published today); P5 refuses a second same-day automated article) + stale-worker re-dispatch; requires `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN`; diagnose quota BEFORE schedules, schedules BEFORE code.
- **PLAN JOB RECOVERY LAW:** enqueued plan jobs are SURVIVABLE state — persist in localStorage (24h TTL) with mount-reattached watchers; finished jobs surface as one-click recovery cards (never double-saved); regeneration enqueues the replacement FIRST and deletes the old draft only after the new plan arrives and only while still a draft; staff requesters bypass the swap quota.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN AI DISPATCH LAW:** enqueue alone is NOT enough — every enqueue path push-triggers the runner (`src/lib/ai-runner-dispatch.ts`, fail-open); `POST /api/ai/jobs` answers honest `runnerDispatched` + `etaMinutes`; `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` is REQUIRED in production; new job types register in FOUR places (AI_JOB_TYPES + JOB_GATE + sanitizeJobPayload + processor registry); completed `article_generate` jobs are ALWAYS materialized (pipeline-dispatched PUBLISH through P5; fallback land as DRAFTS); the runner exits NON-ZERO on permanent failure.
- **COACH PIPELINE PARITY (Phase 162):** `article_generate` rides the SAME paired pipeline as automatic generation — enqueue dispatches `blog-post-{ar|en}.yml` via workflow_dispatch (`src/lib/blog-pipeline-dispatch.ts`, FAIL-OPEN) and the row becomes a dispatch RECEIPT; an optional coach topic (≥10 chars) rides `PIPELINE_TOPIC` → P0 seals it into MY side of the brief; the single-shot generator stays the FALLBACK; the automatic cron slots, concurrency groups and one-article-per-day quota are UNTOUCHED.
- **ARTICLE QUALITY FLOOR + ANTI-FORMULA (numbers corrected 2026-09-29, AUDIT_REPORT §9-0.4 — the old «ASK = 1100-1400 words, 6-9 sections» described the FALLBACK generator, not the standard):** MAIN PIPELINE ask = **1500-2500 words** (P2 mandatory ask) with **execution floors ≥1200 at BOTH writing steps** (R4, Execution-Path Audit 2026-09-29 — `BLOG_EXECUTION_WORD_FLOOR`: P2 generation and P4 review reject short output AT THEIR OWN STEP, where the ×3 retry is a cheap fresh model draw; the old 400-word parse nets let 419-1271-word drafts AND review shrinkage (live-measured 1201→752) burn images+review and die at P5; the 1200-1300 band rides the R1 repair loop's p2 force regeneration) and a deterministic **P5 publish floor ≥1300 words** (too-short drafts fail honestly at P5 and the day's slot is topped up — same mechanism as the Latin gate), **5-7 H2 sections**, FAQ 4-7 article-specific questions to faq_json (deterministic `filterFaqsByRelevance` gate ≥2 shared words; `splitFaqSection` lifts the markdown FAQ section in three LIFT-ONLY formats — `**bold**`, `### H3`, and R4's conservative plain-text question line (≤25 words, ends ?/؟, never steals an answer's first line) that recovered the live «FAQ count 0» deaths of row 38f230fb), 2-3 real internal links, distinct meta_title; floors are rejection NETS; random opening archetype; shallow drafts requeue; the single-shot fallback (ai-job-processors) keeps its own 1100-1400 DRAFT spec (coach-review drafts — never auto-published); lowering any contract requires owner approval in the same commit message.
- **P5 QUALITY BATTERY (AUDIT_REPORT §9-1.4, 2026-09-29 — expanded publish gate, all deterministic):** besides the 1300-word floor, P5 enforces via `src/lib/blog-quality-gates.ts`: H2 sections ≥5 · final FAQ count within 4-7 (`EDITORIAL_FAQ_COUNT_RANGE`) · ≥1 external link to an AUTHORITY domain (`EDITORIAL_AUTHORITY_DOMAINS` — the whole blog is YMYL, so the floor applies to every article) · anchor-grammar gate (raw keyword-list anchors / >5-word stacks rejected unless an exact published-title anchor) · quoted-search-phrase gate (the §C4 lowercase pasted-query pattern, EN+AR). ANY violation → the row fails honestly with the gate diagnostic → the 23:40 backstop tops the day up (same mechanism as Latin/length gates). Weaker drafts are REJECTED, never silently published.
- **UNIFIED EDITORIAL CONSTITUTION (AUDIT_REPORT §9-1.2, 2026-09-29):** the article writing laws — LANG / ANSWER-FIRST / E-E-A-T / FACT GUARD / DEPTH-OVER-LENGTH / FAQ CONTRACT / authority-domain whitelist / anchor-grammar law — live ONCE in `src/lib/blog-editorial-law.ts` and are composed byte-exact by P1/P2/P4 AND the coach-path fallback generator (the AR_MSA_EDITOR_LAW Phase-175 pattern, generalized). Forking a law text into any prompt builder is FORBIDDEN — the no-fork canaries (blog-editorial-law.test.ts + blog-faq-quality source pins) fail the build on drift.
- **RESEARCH FALLBACK VISIBILITY (AUDIT_REPORT §9-1.3, 2026-09-29):** a P0 run whose model chain fails and falls to the static curated pool is stamped `researchSource:"fallback"` on the queue row's bundle + a loud P0-route alert in the run log + a queue-health panel issue (24h window) — fallback is never silent again. The GSC real-search source remains owner-blocked (needs the owner's Search Console API credentials).
- **OWNER REVIEW WORKFLOW (AUDIT_REPORT §9-2.1, 2026-09-29 · migration 0097):** every pipeline-published article lands `review_status='pending'` with `last_reviewed_at` NULL — its page shows the honest «AI-generated · medical review pending» byline and the Article schema OMITS `reviewedBy`/`lastReviewed` (seo.ts honest-review law). The claims flip to TRUE only when the owner actually reviews: the admin-gated `POST /api/admin/blog/review` action (BlogAdminView «اعتماد» button) or the owner's own editor publish/save stamps `review_status='reviewed'` + the real `last_reviewed_at`. NEVER set last_reviewed_at automatically — the old template printed a fabricated review claim on every article (audit C2/F2).
- **HONEST CITATION POLICY + LINK-VERIFY GATE (AUDIT_REPORT §9-2.2, 2026-09-29):** citing evidence is allowed ONLY as markdown links to `EDITORIAL_AUTHORITY_DOMAINS` (WHO/NIH/CDC/Mayo + the sport-science bodies ACSM/ISSN/NSCA/health.gov/NASM/ACE/eatright — audit-2 owner order 2026-09-29: the corpus is training/nutrition-heavy, not purely medical, so sports articles now have natural citation targets for the G4 floor) — the FACT GUARD law text carries it; P5 then HEAD-verifies every external link in the final body (`src/lib/blog-link-verify.ts`): confirmed-dead citations (404/410) are removed to their anchor text BEFORE the quality battery, so the G4 authority floor measures the verified state; inconclusive verdicts (403/405/429/timeout) keep the link (fail-open — an authority that refuses HEAD must never cost a good citation). Fabricating studies/authors/titles/URLs/statistics remains absolutely forbidden.
- **QUARTERLY EDITORIAL-LAW PRUNING (AUDIT_REPORT §9-2.6, 2026-09-29):** first week of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct (same cadence as the §12.5.2 docs-gate spot-check), review the live instruction set as «قانون حي × حارس × أثر مقاس»: every prompt law must name its guard (or be unguarded by explicit choice) and show measured effect in the sample; a law with no measured effect merges into a sibling or is deleted in that frame, its narrative moving verbatim to `archive/PROMPT-LAW-HISTORY.md` (the append-only prompt-law history — prompt files keep CURRENT-LAW comments only, never phase chronologies). The cycle exists because instruction accumulation is a measured root cause (audit C9/F15: 190+ phase layers, 10-12 parallel law blocks per prompt).
- **ARABIC PURITY LAW (Phase 176):** AR articles carry ZERO bare Latin/English words inside Arabic prose — exceptions: parenthetical glosses after the Arabic term and brand names; detection is DETERMINISTIC (`scanLatinContamination` in blog-msa.ts), enforced at P4 (targeted repair + re-gate) and P5 (final body gate fails honestly; contaminated FAQ answers drop); one law, three surfaces (AR_MSA_EDITOR_LAW / LANG_RULE.ar / coach prompt) — no fork. **Localized repair (R2, Execution-Path Audit §9-4, 2026-09-29):** the P4 repair no longer regenerates the whole article (~9.5k-token payload — excluded Groq, returned English junk; 5 of 7 AR final failures in the audit window): `repairArabicLatinContamination` runs a DETERMINISTIC dictionary pass first (`LATIN_REPAIR_DICTIONARY` in blog-pipeline.ts — the Phase-176 prompt's own table + audit-window-measured tokens, phrase keys before fragments; zero AI calls for the covered class), then a SMALL token-only conversion call (tag `blog:latin-tokens-ar`; payload = the token list, est. <1k tokens ⇒ Groq-eligible again; JSON {token→arabic} per-value-gated — only pure-MSA Arabic terms accepted, Latin/dialect/junk values rejected) applied through the scanner-mirroring engine (fences/glosses/URLs/link-targets never touched); the judges `validateMsaConversion`/`scanLatinContamination` stay byte-identical (blog-msa.ts untouched by R2). Rollback: `LATIN_REPAIR_LEGACY=1` restores the pre-R2 full-article path verbatim. Canaries: `blog-latin-repair-r2.test.ts` (the five live failure classes + payload/whitelist-collision/engine-protection pins).
- **QUALITY-FIRST LAW — OWNER GENERAL CONDITION:** maximum quality for EVERYTHING; prompts, floors, and model order preserve-or-raise the ask; smaller models are last-resort fallbacks; resilience work increases AVAILABILITY of strong models, never substitutes weak output.
- **SEO-SLUG + IMAGE BUNDLE LAW:** every article_generate draft lands COMPLETE — model-produced English SEO slug (translates the MEANING, never transliterates; latin-only nets with the dated fallback as LAST net) + 3-5 ENGLISH image_queries resolved Pexels-first (images[0] = featured + cover_alt; images[1..] at section boundaries); slug/image enrichment can NEVER fail the article.
- **ONE-SLUG-LAW:** ALL slug logic lives ONLY in `src/lib/slug.ts` — canaries fail the build if a local copy reappears; the M15 save gate remains the boundary verifier.
- **TOOL RESULTS UX LAWS:** the editor AI-results panel is APPEND-ONLY with DONE-job hydration (≤24h) + manual refresh; dismissed ids persist in localStorage; «نسخ» copies ONLY the paste-able deliverable; failed-row alerts dismissible via the `.delete().in("id", ids)` shape; every standalone image block carries its own safe swap button replacing EXACTLY that occurrence.
- **CANARY PINNING POLICY (Phase 290 — ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit P2-3):** canaries pin BEHAVIOR and STRUCTURE first — exact cosmetic COUNTS only where the count is itself the law (image-safety v3, MSA purity, slug law, UI-wiring parity); a copy tweak must not require same-commit test edits, and a cosmetic count should be asserted structurally (exists/ordered/once) instead of numerically. True regression pins are never weakened.
- **GUARD-COMMITMENT COROLLARY:** a guard that is not COMMITTED is not a guard — any script a workflow references must appear in the SAME commit.
- **PROJECT-WIDE PREVENTION LAW:** button → dead target (`check-ui-wiring.sh`), type without processor / orphan processor (CI + ai-jobs-visibility parity), dishonest success (explicit non-zero exits), silent rot (`/api/ai/queue-health`). Feature DoD: button → route exists, job → processor, visible materialization, honest runner exit, docs in the SAME commit.
- **RATE-LIMIT RESILIENCE LAW:** free-tier 429s are TRANSIENT — retries must OUTLIVE the window, not re-burn it (70s sleep after a rate-limit requeue; heavy article calls walk the model chain — corrected 2026-09-29 (AUDIT_REPORT §9-0.4): P1 `maxModels: 2`, P2 `maxModels: 3` (R3, Execution-Path Audit 2026-09-29 — was 2; the 480s chain budget funds the third entry, Groq re-admitted via the per-entry clamp), P4 `maxModels: 4`, latin-repair `maxModels: 3` — the old «maxModels 5» matched no call site; R2 (2026-09-29) split the latin-repair site: the live token call `blog:latin-tokens-ar` runs `maxModels: 3`, the legacy full-article path — reachable only via the LATIN_REPAIR_LEGACY rollback flag — keeps its original 3).
- **REPAIR LOOP LAW (Execution-Path Audit §8.2 R1, 2026-09-29):** a deterministic P5 gate failure is a REPAIR DIRECTIVE, never a terminal event by itself — the 500 body carries a machine-readable `rerunTarget` from the closed-set message↔target map (`src/lib/blog-repair-target.ts`, unit-pinned to the live failure messages so wording drift breaks a canary), `run-step.mts` translates it to exit code 3 + a `RERUN_TARGET=<step>` stdout line, and `run-step.sh` EXECUTES the directive in-run: it re-runs the targeted step and every step between it and P5 on the SAME queue row — ≤ `MAX_REPAIRS` (2) cycles — before the honest markFailed of today (`p2-content` repair rides `?force=1`: regenerate content over the draft, research0/outline/images preserved; P0–P4 keep their plain ×3 transient retry; quota/duplicate skips are 200s and never enter the loop). The loop changes WHO recovers a failed row and WHEN — NEVER what is acceptable: no gate, threshold, or editorial rule is weakened. Rollback = exit code 3 → 1 (the loop stalls itself). Loop mechanics are pinned by `scripts/blog-runner/run-step-loop-test.sh` (simulated-GHA integration matrix, committed evidence). **Repair observability (R5, same audit §10 Phase R5, 2026-09-30):** every directive STAMPS a cumulative `repairLoop` marker into the row's bundle (`stampQueueRowRepairDirective` — survives the chain because p2-force/p4 spread the bundle; the researchSource/coachRequested stamp precedent) and increments the run's `REPAIRS_USED` GITHUB_ENV export, so the workflow Summary line + the `/api/ai/queue-health` `repair` counter (14-day window: published · afterRepair · exhausted · sharePct · recoveryPct) measure «repair-first vs regenerate» from DB truth. Pure observability — no gate, status, or budget behavior changes. Canaries: `blog-repair-r5-observability.test.ts` + the R5 describe in `blog-repair-contract.test.ts`.
- Never log the AI response in production paths (PII / partial reasoning); local fallbacks (`src/lib/ai-local.ts`) stay for graceful degradation; any change to the AI system prompt requires owner approval; EVO chat quota accounting stays server-side in the tamper-proof `evo_chat_usage` ledger (0022) — never client-written rows again.

## 9. Final Report Format

> **Deprecated (2026-08-24):** Superseded by §12.9. Do not use this format.

## 10. Git & Commit Conventions

- Branch off `main` for non-trivial changes; the owner may merge feature branches or commit directly to `main` for small fixes.
- **Commit author email (LAW — hardened 2026-09-29, GIT-IDENTITY):** `muscleshubfit@gmail.com` for BOTH author and committer on every commit, no exceptions (audit/report commits included). Agents keep their display name (`Super Z`, `Alkemos Agent`…) but MUST set this email first: `git config user.email muscleshubfit@gmail.com`. WHY: Vercel's Git integration authorizes each push-triggered deployment by matching the commit author email against the members of the `muscleshubfit-2941` team — any other address (`*@alkemos.local`, `*@alkemos.com`, `z@container`, `*@users.noreply.github.com`, ad-hoc audit identities) yields «attempted to deploy … not a member of the team» and the deployment is BLOCKED. Incident 2026-09-29: audit commit `fe613c04` signed `Independent Audit <audit@alkemos.local>` → Vercel refused the deploy (GitHub Actions itself green; production unaffected — docs-only commit). Recovery: NO history rewrite — the next member-email commit supersedes the blocked deployment. Pre-push identity check (extends §3.5): `git log -1 --format='%ae'` must print `muscleshubfit@gmail.com`.
- Prefixes: `feat:` new feature · `fix:` bug fix · `docs:` documentation only · `refactor:` no behavior change · `security:` security-sensitive (pre-approved per §7) · `chore:` tooling, deps, build config.
- **Commit-message budget (Phase 237 — migration Phase 5; applies from Phase 237 forward, history untouched):** subject ≤ 72 chars; body ≤ 500 chars; the body POINTS at the task's `worklog.md` entry (Task ID) instead of restating it — one narrative per change, three surfaces that agree (audit F-06: worklog + STATE + commit message must not triple-store the same prose).
- **Deploy-skip law (VERCEL-USAGE-6, 2026-09-21 — enacts audit doc §10.5-2(a)):** a commit touching ONLY `docs/**`, `archive/**`, `.github/**`, `scripts/**`, or any `**.md` MUST carry `[vercel skip]` in its subject — Vercel then skips the build entirely while GitHub Actions still runs it (`[vercel skip]` is Vercel-specific and does NOT mute the push-triggered cleanup workflow the way `[skip ci]` would). Why: every build books +0.42GB Deployment / +0.29GB Functions on the usage meters instantly while deletions deduct only at the period reset (audit §10.3/§10.7) — docs-only builds are pure meter cost with zero site change. Never add the token when `src/**`, `public/**`, `supabase/**`, or build config (`next.config.*`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`) changed — those need a real deploy. Mechanical backstop (owner, one-time — Project ▸ Settings ▸ Git ▸ Ignored Build Step ▸ Custom): `bash -c "git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep -vE '^(docs/|archive/|\.github/|scripts/)' | grep -vE '\.md$' | grep -q . && exit 0 || exit 1"` (exit 0 = build, exit 1 = skip).
- Push to `origin` only after the local verification step (§3.5) passes — if `tsc --noEmit` fails, do not push.

## 11. When in Doubt

Ask the human supervisor — early, not after a half-built feature. Cite the exact file + line + observed behavior. Prefer reversible changes (a new file is reversible, a dropped column is not). Document assumptions in the final report under "Potential risks" / "Implementation findings".

---

## 12. Project Workflow Rules (Adopted 2026-08-21)

> **Status:** Active binding policy — applies to every task from 2026-08-21 onward; changeable only by explicit Owner directive. These rules supplement §3 and §4; where they conflict with an older section of this file, these rules win.

### 12.1 Communication

Reports short and direct; no repeated explanations or already-executed steps; no scope expansion or reopening finished tasks without a reason; stop and ask the Owner only on genuine ambiguity.

### 12.2 Execution Flow

Every task executes in this order inside the same task:

```
IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → DOCUMENT → COMMIT → PUSH
```

Do NOT wait for a separate instruction to validate, document, commit, or push — unless the Owner explicitly asked to skip one of these steps (for example, "show me the report before commit").

### 12.3 No Redundant Verification

Do not create a separate command to re-verify what was already verified; results belong in the task's own report; after success, move directly to the next task.

### 12.4 Task Continuity

Do not redo completed steps; preserve the current task's state; with queued tasks, advance automatically; never start a new task from memory or guessing — use the project's actual state (code, migrations, docs, worklog).

### 12.5 Documentation

Document every completed task while executing it, using the existing files (`STATE.md`, `worklog.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `README.md` — status history frozen in `archive/` since Phase 115) — no new documentation system if the existing one suffices; one comprehensive review pass is allowed at the end of a large body of work.

> **Consolidated (2026-08-24; repointed 2026-09-19 — Phase 236, migration Phase 4):** doc lifecycle statuses live in `docs/README.md` (the registry). Do not create new documentation files — except `STATE.md` (Phase 107, owner-approved knowledge operating system; §3.6/§3.8), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Phase 115, owner-directed contribution policy), and `docs/README.md` (Phase 236, migration-plan-sanctioned registry).

#### 12.5.1 `worklog.md` Entry Template (Binding)

Every task MUST append exactly one entry to `worklog.md` following this template. No free-form entries are allowed.

```markdown
---
Task ID: <unique ID, e.g. AFFILIATE-BANNERS-2026-08-24>
Agent: <agent name, e.g. Main (Z User)>
Task: <one-line description of the task>

Work Log:
- <concrete step 1>
- <concrete step 2>
- ...

Stage Summary:
- <key results / important decisions / produced artifacts>
- Push status: <pushed | not-pushed>
- Commit SHA (optional, post-push): <sha>
```

Rules: the `---` separator before each entry is mandatory (append-only log); `Task ID` MUST be unique across the file (search before adding); `Work Log` is bulleted, factual, chronological; `Stage Summary` records the push status (matches §12.9). **SHA law (Phase 288 — ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit RC-1):** the commit SHA is OPTIONAL post-push provenance only — `git log` is the authoritative ledger (check B already ancestor-verifies STATE's recorded commit). A commit can never contain its own SHA: the «تسجيل SHA بكوميت مستقل» follow-up-commit practice is RETIRED (it doubled every task's commits and re-ran 4 workflows + Supabase Preview per task). **One task = one commit.**

**Entry budget + evidence (Phase 237 — migration Phase 5; hardened Phase 288 — ARCH-REMEDIATION):** each entry ≤ 60 lines (LIVE-VERIF entries ≤ 40); detail belongs in committed scripts or `docs/README.md` registry rows, not prose. An entry that cites a verification script or any evidence artifact must point at a **committed** path (`scripts/live-verify/<task>.sh` or similar) or state explicitly «local-only, not preserved» — a log referencing evidence that exists nowhere is a false log (audit F-11). **The live file IS the active window (Phase 288 hard law, audit P1-1): ≤ 12 entries AND ≤ 128 KB, enforced by `scripts/docs_audit.py` check H5** — anything below the window rotates verbatim to `archive/WORKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` in the SAME commit via `python3 scripts/worklog_rotate.py` (size-driven, never calendar-driven, never one-shot).

#### 12.5.2 Documentation Audit (exception-driven — Phase 293)

> **Rewritten (2026-09-28 — ARCH-REMEDIATION, audit P4-3):** the mandatory MONTHLY full-registry pass is RETIRED — it audited what the per-push gate already verifies (check M re-validates every registry row's paths and coverage on EVERY push; check N re-verifies CI_GATES coverage), and its DOC-AUDIT worklog entries grew the worklog it was auditing (the audit-of-the-audit recursion, RC-5). The registry is now maintained EXCEPTION-DRIVEN:

- **Per push (automatic):** checks M/N (registry bidirectional + workflow coverage) + the full `scripts/docs_audit.py` battery — a drift the old monthly pass could catch is caught at push time instead.
- **Quarterly spot-check (first week of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct):** review the gate itself, not the registry — per-check-family failure rates over the quarter (a check that never fails is a candidate to retire/merge; one that fails constantly is a fix-up generator), plus the check-family budget below. Log it as a `DOC-AUDIT-YYYY-MM-DD` worklog entry ONLY if it changes something.
- **After any force-push or major git operation (within 24 hours):** one `docs_audit.py` + `docs_parity.py` run — the standing rule, unchanged.

**Check-family budget (audit P4-2, law):** `scripts/docs_audit.py` is capped at its current check families; any NEW check must RETIRE or MERGE an existing one in the same commit (H5 merged into H and check I was retired to pay for it — the precedent). The gate governs the docs; this budget governs the gate.

### 12.6 Duplicate Tasks

Treat EVO AI and AI Chat as ONE task (`EVO AI / AI Chat`); never record the same function as two tasks under different names; check whether an equivalent task already exists before adding any.

### 12.7 AI Master Roadmap

Aggregate AI task lists from actual source code, `STATE.md`, `worklog.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, and context; classify each task as `COMPLETED` / `IN PROGRESS` / `DEFERRED` / `NOT STARTED`; do NOT start implementation merely because a missing task was discovered — stick to the task the Owner assigns.

### 12.8 Source of Truth

Priority (highest wins):

1. Actual Code & Config (`src/**`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `vercel.json`)
2. Database / Migrations (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`)
3. QA Evidence (`STATE.md` ملخص جودة المرحلة · `archive/QA_CHECKLIST.md` frozen at Phase 115, manual smoke tests in commit messages)
4. Project Documentation (`README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`)
5. Conversation Context
6. General Knowledge

If documentation conflicts with code, **code wins**.

### 12.9 Final Report

After every task: what was done · verification result · commit SHA · push status · next task · raw SQL links (mandatory for schema/DB tasks — §6). **PLAIN-STEP EXECUTION GUIDE (BINDING):** any task requiring a MANUAL owner action (run SQL, trigger a workflow, set an env var, redeploy, click anything) ships a short numbered plain-language walkthrough: exact URL → exact button/tab → what to paste/select → what success looks like → how to roll back. Assume a non-technical reader; reporting a manual step without this guide is an INVALID delivery (same severity as §6 without the raw link).

### 12.10 Out-of-Scope Prohibited

Do not add steps or improvements outside the current task's scope; do not wait for a new instruction to validate / document / commit / push after task completion, unless the Owner asked otherwise.
