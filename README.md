> **Stack:** Next.js 16 · React 19 · TypeScript · Supabase · Tailwind CSS 4 · OpenRouter + Groq + NVIDIA NIM (AI) · Vercel
> **Quality:** every push is audited by automated CI gates — types, lint, tests, schema-drift, docs parity, anti-regression
> **Status:** in production · current live status: [`STATE.md`](./STATE.md)
> **Last updated:** 2026-09-27 (Ph 286 — HOME-REFINE-286: the exact AI-allowance wording, four-fact colored macro cells on every food card (homepage + /foods), the complete wrapped category set, and a fully static hero)

Alkemos is a bilingual (English + full Arabic RTL mirror) fitness and nutrition
platform that unifies training, nutrition, and AI planning in one product:
real content libraries, free planning tools, an AI coach (**EVO**), human
coaching, and an automated bilingual blog — backed by membership tiers, an
affiliate program, a complete B2B coach system, and a full admin platform.

This repository holds the entire production platform. The repository is
**private** (owner decision 2026-09-24) — the code is **proprietary and
confidential**, accessible only to owner-authorized collaborators
(see [License](#-license)).

## 🧭 What Alkemos offers

### The platform homepage (`src/components/views/LandingView.tsx`)
The homepage is a true PLATFORM homepage — concise sections with CARDS
that link to the real pages, mirroring the header's service nav
(HOME-PLATFORM-284, polished by HOME-POLISH-285, refined by
HOME-REFINE-286): a Training section
(the muscle-group browser previewing SIX real exercises per family,
fed by the server-provided curated samples), a Programs carousel, a
FOOD LIBRARY section previewing the `/foods` hub the same way the
exercise library is previewed (the complete nine-category set,
WRAPPED at every viewport — never a single scrolling row — routes into
`/foods?cat=…` filtered views; SIX real curated food cards — each
carrying the SAME four-fact labeled macro cells as the `/foods` cards
(calories · protein · carbs · fat, in the food pages' own colors) —
link into the food
detail pages), the diet-systems carousel, a Tools section of VISUAL
TILES (the five calculators/tracker PLUS the manual Meal Planner
«ابنِها بنفسك», every tile linking to its tool page — the tools
derive from `src/lib/tools-shared.ts` and never run on the homepage),
the honest free-allowance band (the free monthly plan quota, placed
right before the AI section so it introduces the planners), and an
AI Planning section — deliberately distinct from the tools — carrying
TWO strong explicitly-AI-powered planner cards with filled chrome
CTAs (the AI Workout Planner, and the AI Meal Planner promising a
STRUCTURED full-day plan with portions in grams — not mere
suggestions) plus EVO as a full-width card with a chat button that
opens the real floating widget (the chat-surface law). NO tool runs
on the homepage — the pages own the doing; the homepage owns the
navigation. The hero carries exactly two CTAs (login/signup + the
memberships page) over a compact one-row proof strip; memberships
render as small cards (prices derive from `memberships.ts` — never
literals; each card lists its tier's REAL limit-derived feature rows
with the same checkseal mark the memberships page uses) — PRO wears
the section's single dark highlighted card — each tier carries a
clear visible CTA (`.btn-outline` on the light cards,
`.btn-outline-dark` on the dark Pro card), plus one online-coaching
card. The FAQ closes the page as a directly-visible grid of Q&A
cards (no accordion). Motion is once-only, transform/opacity-only,
and fully `prefers-reduced-motion`-safe (DESIGN.md §7.1.2/§7.4.2) —
and the HERO is fully static (HOME-REFINE-286: no animated diagram,
no entrance beats, no arrows on its CTAs).

### Free content & tools — no account needed
- **Exercise library** — 868 exercises with start/end position images
  (self-hosted WebP), bilingual names / instructions / tips in modern standard
  Arabic + English, filterable by muscle group, equipment, and level
  (`src/lib/exercises.ts`)
- **Food database** — 8,830 foods with per-100g macros, bilingual labels and
  search (`src/lib/foods.ts`); the hand-curated foods plus a bounded,
  batch-expanded USDA band carry real Arabic names (`SEO_FOOD_BAND` in
  `src/lib/seo-food-band.ts` is the single source for the band;
  `/api/food-search` takes `?lang=ar|en` for language-matched result names)
- **Workout programs** — 7 structured, ready-to-follow programs for home,
  home-equipment, and gym, from beginner to advanced
  (`src/lib/workout-programs.ts`)
- **Free tools** — calorie calculator, BMI, macros, body-fat %, water tracker,
  and an interactive meal planner, each with email delivery of results and
  bilingual inline validation (`src/lib/tools-shared.ts` is the single source
  of the tools list)
- **AI planners** — AI meal planner and AI workout planner with a free trial,
  no signup required (a plan generated without an account stays on that device
  until you create one, then syncs to the account)
- **Blog & comparison hub** — bilingual articles plus focused
  "Alkemos vs …" comparison pages (`/blog`, `/compare`)

### EVO — the AI coach
- Floating chat widget on every page + a dedicated `/evo` experience, with
  **live SSE streaming** answers (raw tokens arrive as they are generated)
- **10 messages/day free** (subscribers unlimited), free memory of goals and
  preferences, and opt-in weekly follow-up emails
- A safety layer answers self-harm / eating-disorder signals with a static safe
  redirect — those never reach a model (`src/lib/evo-safety.ts`); plan and
  swap requests are quota-gated through an intent layer (`src/lib/evo-intent.ts`)
- Dispatch telemetry, a frequent-question cache, and a weekly automated AR/EN
  quality eval, surfaced read-only at `/admin/evo-analytics`

### Memberships

| Tier | Price | AI plan generations / month* | EVO chat | Plan swaps | Saved results |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free (& guests, no signup) | $0 | 2 | 10 msgs/day | — | 3 |
| Premium | $14.99/mo · $119/yr | 4 | Unlimited | 3/week | 50 + export |
| Pro | $29.99/mo · $239/yr | 8 | Unlimited | 6/week | 200 + export, ad-free |
| Coaching | $39.99/mo · $359/yr | 8 + human coach | Unlimited | 6/week | 200 + export |

\* One unified monthly pool for nutrition + workout generations combined —
only successful generations count; failed attempts and edits never burn quota.
Prices, quotas, and tier features are defined in a single source:
`src/lib/memberships.ts` + the quota engine `src/lib/tier-limits.ts`.
Every paid tier carries a 7-day conditional refund (no-features-used,
ledger-based — `src/lib/refund.ts`).

### For coaches (B2B)
- **Client dashboard** — lifecycle filter tabs and per-client management
  (overview, subscription, plans, AI plans, questionnaires, progress)
- **AI plans** — generation draws from the client's own balance
  (ownership-checked); manual edits and per-element regeneration are unlimited
- **Wallet system** — fixed per-client activation pricing paid to the platform,
  receipt-reviewed top-ups (InstaPay / Vodafone Cash / PayPal), activation
  gated on sufficient balance
- **Public coach page** — claimable slug, landing editor, ads, certificates
  (`/coaches/[slug]`)
- **Affiliate program** — 20% commission on referred subscription payments,
  $10 minimum payout, 7-day hold, automatic reversal on refunds
  (`src/lib/affiliate-engine-server.ts`)

### Site coaches (B2C) & the admin platform
- Every coach is `site` (platform-employed) or `b2b` (independent business) —
  one-tap toggle in the admin roster
- Site coaches follow up platform members 1↔1 through a dedicated assignments
  surface, deliberately separate from the B2B money relation
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`, admin-only): unified client roster with
  role/lifecycle filters, finances (site money vs coach money), payments and
  the refund console, blog CMS, coach-system center, wallets, leads,
  referrals, saved results, and EVO analytics
- **Payments** — PayPal (create / capture / webhook) plus manual review
  (InstaPay / Vodafone Cash / bank transfer)

### Bilingual by architecture
- A full Arabic RTL mirror at `/ar/*` — every public surface exists in both
  languages with reciprocal hreflang pairs
- Dynamic `lang` / `dir` on the root HTML tag per route locale, and a
  `Content-Language` header from middleware
- A custom lightweight i18n provider (no next-intl) with shared AR/EN copy in
  the source

### Data layer
- Supabase Postgres with **Row Level Security on every auto-applied table**
  and role-aware RPCs for the admin roster
- The schema evolves through a **versioned migration registry** —
  `supabase/migrations/` with [`INDEX.md`](./supabase/migrations/INDEX.md) as
  the binding ledger; migrations apply to production automatically through the
  Supabase–GitHub integration
- TypeScript DB types are generated from the schema
  (`src/lib/supabase/types.ts`)
- Daily automated JSON backups run to a **private** repository
  (`.github/workflows/db-backup.yml`) — user data never lands in this repo

### Admin-editable site copy (no deploy needed)
The site's static marketing copy — the homepage sections and the
about / privacy / terms / FAQ pages, in **Arabic and English separately** —
is editable by the site owner from the admin panel at
`/admin/site-content` («نصوص الموقع», in the Content section of the admin
sidebar). A save writes the `site_content` table (RLS: public read,
admin-only writes, migration `0094`) and the pages pick it up within ~5
minutes through ISR (the same 300 s window the blog uses) — **no git commit,
no CI run, no Vercel deploy**. The copy that ships in the code
(`src/lib/site-content/`) is the built-in default for every field, so a
missing or malformed row always renders the current wording verbatim — the
page can never go blank. Clearing a field in the editor restores its
built-in text; `{exercises}` / `{foods}` inside paragraphs keep showing the
live library sizes. Prices, plan limits, quota lines, and other
policy/number restatements are deliberately **not** editable there — they
derive from their single sources (`memberships.ts`, `refund.ts`, …).

### AI layer
One unified provider layer (`src/lib/ai-provider.ts`) is the only path to any
model — OpenRouter, Groq, and NVIDIA NIM — offering sequential
strongest-model chains, a `Promise.any` race mode for fast swaps, and SSE
streaming for chat. Every sequential path is budget-clamped so
`maxModels × timeoutMs` never exceeds ~52s (the serverless limit), and
long-running generation (the blog pipeline, queued AI jobs) runs on GitHub
Actions runners instead of serverless functions.

### Automated content pipeline
The bilingual blog is generated end-to-end — research → outline → article →
images → review → publish — as scheduled GitHub Actions workflows, one English
and one Arabic article per day. The pipeline carries editorial gates: Arabic
modern-standard purity checks, image-safety rules, FAQ single-display, and
topic selection deduplicated against the search-intent map
(`src/lib/intent-map.ts`) so articles never compete with canonical pages.

### SEO / GEO
JSON-LD structured data across the site (`src/lib/seo.ts`), dynamic XML
sitemaps (pages, blog, foods, exercises, collections, comparisons), a
`robots.txt` that welcomes AI crawlers, `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` for
generative engines, bilingual RSS feeds, and dedicated Open Graph cards per
surface family.

### Automated quality gates
Every push and pull request is audited on GitHub Actions by gates that
re-derive the truth from the code itself:

- **quality** — `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors), ESLint, and the full Vitest suite
- **parity** — migration-registry heading vs filesystem truth, schema ↔ types
  mirror audit, and the knowledge-system consistency audit
- **guard** — anti-regression scan for retired identifiers
- **Supabase Preview** — migrations run against a preview database before
  production

Full narrative — what each gate derives and why: [`docs/CI_GATES.md`](./docs/CI_GATES.md)

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20.9+** (CI runs Node 22 — or **Bun 1.3+**)
- A **Supabase** project (free tier works)
- An **OpenRouter** API key (free tier works — the platform uses free models;
  Groq and NVIDIA NIM keys extend the fallback chain)

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muscleshubfit-cpu/alkemos.git   # private repo — requires owner-granted access
cd alkemos
bun install                  # or: npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in your keys
bun dev                      # or: npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Minimum environment for a working instance (full annotated reference in
[`.env.example`](./.env.example)):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
OPENROUTER_API=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Demo mode:** without Supabase variables the app runs on localStorage —
demo coach `ahmed@coach.app` / `coach123`, demo client
`client@demo.app` / `client123` (seeded in `src/lib/data/auth.ts`).

### Database setup
Apply `supabase/migrations/` to your Supabase project (numeric files first,
then timestamped files in order — or simply `supabase db push` with the CLI).
The registry, naming laws, and manual-script rules live in
[`supabase/migrations/INDEX.md`](./supabase/migrations/INDEX.md).

### Deployment (Vercel)
Import the repository on Vercel, add the environment variables, and deploy.
[`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) carries the production posture: Frankfurt
region, security headers (HSTS, CSP + report-only, X-Frame-Options,
Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy), immutable caching for static assets and
exercise images, and scheduled jobs (weekly progress reminder, daily pipeline
dispatch). Site URL, analytics, and ads integrations are env-configured.
