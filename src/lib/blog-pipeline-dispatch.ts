/**
 * BLOG PIPELINE DISPATCH — coach generation rides the AUTOMATIC pipeline.
 *
 * PHASE 162 (owner directive 2026-09-10: «مطلوب مسار الكوتش للتوليد يكون
 * نفس مسار التوليد الالى دون تعطيل للتوليد الالى»): article_generate no
 * longer runs a parallel generation system of its own by default — the
 * coach's request DISPATCHES the exact workflow the automatic daily
 * generation uses (`blog-post-ar.yml` / `blog-post-en.yml`, the same files
 * the 05:00/22:00 UTC cron slots fire). The article therefore inherits the
 * full automatic path for free: P0 research → P1 outline → P2 content
 * (1500-2500 words) → P3 images → P4 review/links → P5 PUBLISH + sitemap
 * + the bilingual pairing handshake (`linked_post_id` bidirectional).
 *
 * AUTOMATIC GENERATION IS UNTOUCHED: the cron triggers, concurrency groups
 * (`blog-pipeline-ar` / `blog-pipeline-en`, cancel-in-progress false) and
 * Phase-119 one-slot-per-day tables are exactly as they were — a coach
 * dispatch simply queues another run of the same workflow (never cancels a
 * running one, never skips a scheduled one).
 *
 * TOPIC OVERRIDE: an optional coach topic (≥ MIN_TOPIC_CHARS so it can be
 * legally sealed into a shared brief) rides workflow_dispatch inputs →
 * `PIPELINE_TOPIC` → P0, which seals it into MY side of the pair's brief
 * (the twin keeps its researched topic). Empty/short topic = the pipeline's
 * own research picks the title — the same «مفروض يختار العنوان بنفس نظام
 * التوليد» behavior the automatic run has.
 *
 * TOKEN: `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` (same secret and same fine-grained-PAT
 * law as `ai-runner-dispatch.ts` — this repo only, Actions: Read+write).
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN: a false return NEVER fails the enqueue — the route
 * leaves the ai_jobs row queued and the proven single-shot draft generator
 * (`runArticleGenerate` in ai-job-processors.ts, hardened by 161.4/161.5)
 * processes it as the fallback, so generation never silently dies.

// PHASE 171 (blog-audit proposal ج — 2026-09-10): DOUBLE-PUBLISH RACE
// CLOSURE. Live evidence: EN published TWO posts on 09-05 (23:07 + 23:33)
// and 09-04; AR two on 09-04 — violating the Phase-119 one-article/day
// law. Root cause: the 23:00 UTC backstop counted RUNS and saw GitHub's
// documented 30–90 min cron delay as a "missed slot" → extra dispatch →
// the delayed scheduled run then fired too → both published. Three
// deterministic layers now close it:
//   (1) GRACE: a slot only counts as "expected" once slot+90 min has
//       passed (GitHub's documented worst-case scheduler delay), so a
//       merely-late scheduled run is never mistaken for a missed one.
//   (2) POST-COUNT COVERAGE: the backstop now counts ACTUAL published
//       posts today (blog_posts) alongside runs — coverage is the max of
//       the two. A post that already landed (any path) means the daily
//       quota is met; no top-up is dispatched for it.
//   (3) P5 publish-layer guard (blog-queue.ts countAutomatedPublishedToday
//       + p5-publish route): even if two runs DO race through, the second
//       AUTOMATIC publish of the same UTC day is refused
//       (skipped_daily_quota) — coach-requested rows are exempt (owner
//       override, Phase 162). The Vercel cron moved 23:00 → 23:40 UTC so
//       the grace window has fully elapsed when the backstop fires.
