 * R1 REPAIR CONTRACT (Execution-Path Audit §8.2 A1, 2026-09-29 —
 * docs/EXECUTION-PATH-AUDIT-AND-RECOVERY-PLAN-2026-09-29.md).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: a deterministic P5 gate failure (word floor, quality
 * battery, Latin body gate) fires on an IMMUTABLE input —
 * `bundle.review.markdown` — so the runner's blind ×3 retry re-runs the
 * SAME checks on the SAME bytes and fails identically every time (live
 * evidence: three byte-identical P5 failures in GHA run 36507693416,
 * ~6 wasted minutes, then markFailed discards a ~95%-complete article).
 * The audit's fix: the failure itself names the step that can repair
 * the row ("— rerun p2-content" / "— rerun p4-review") — those hints
 * were prose for humans with NO executor. This map turns them into a
 * machine-readable contract: P5's 500 body carries `rerunTarget`,
 * `run-step.mts` translates it to exit code 3, and `run-step.sh`
 * executes the repair IN-RUN on the SAME queue row (≤2 cycles) before
 * the honest markFailed of today.
 *
 * THE MAP IS DETERMINISTIC (no model, no heuristics): exact message
 * patterns → exact targets, unit-pinned in
 * `src/lib/__tests__/blog-repair-target.test.ts` against the LIVE
 * error messages from the audit (§3.1). Any rewording of a P5 gate
 * message breaks a canary and forces a same-commit map update — the
 * contract can never drift silently.
 *
 * SCOPE LAW: this module changes WHO recovers a failed row and WHEN —
 * never WHAT is acceptable. No gate, threshold, or editorial rule is
 * weakened anywhere in the loop (owner constraint, audit §11.1).
 * Quota/duplicate-title skips never reach the 500 path (they are 200
 * skips) and infra failures (post insert, queue update) map to null —
 * the current behavior stays correct for both.
