/* Phase 136 (PSI variance fix, 2026-09-07) — next/font migration.
 * BEFORE: 13 @fontsource weight CSS imports (Inter 400-800, Cairo 400-800,
 * Playfair 500-700) = 8 woff2 files (~194KB) discovered only AFTER the
 * render-blocking CSS parsed, each with a plain system-font fallback whose
 * metrics differ from the webfont → the FOUT swap reflowed the ENTIRE page
 * container (Lighthouse layout-shifts: 0.187 of the 0.208 CLS, causes
 * "Web font loaded" inter-latin-700 + playfair-500). AFTER: one VARIABLE
 * font file per family (~40KB), preloaded in <head> in parallel with the
 * CSS, and next/font's automatic metric-adjusted fallback (size-adjust /
 * ascent-override) keeps the fallback swap geometrically identical → the
 * font reflow CLS is eliminated while text stays visible during load
 * (display: swap). Cairo keeps preload:false — its @font-face unicode-range
 * means only /ar pages ever download the arabic subset, and preloading it
 * on EN pages would be pure waste (EN homepage downloaded ZERO Cairo files
 * before and still does).
 *
 * PHASE 218 (D-01 — owner deferred-item reopened 2026-09-17): Cairo moved
 * swap → optional. The P2-5 "Arabic Fallback" face (globals.css) carries
 * Cairo's exact metrics, so a fallback render is geometrically identical —
 * which makes optional the radical CLS end-game: the ~0.04 transient swap
 * pulse on cold+slow first visits (the residue P2-5 documented) can no
 * longer occur, because the browser never swaps mid-page. Trade-off the
 * owner accepted by reopening the item: on a first cold+slow visit the
 * Arabic text may render in the metric-adjusted system face (Cairo is
 * downloaded in the background for FUTURE visits, which then render it
 * instantly from cache). Sora/Outfit stay swap — Latin fallbacks here
 * are metric-adjusted by next/font itself and their swap never measably
 * shifted layout (Phase 136 evidence).
 *
 * EMBER-INK-279 (owner order 2026-09-26 — the 1devtool landing-fitness-
 * studio template transplant): the display/body pair moves to the
 * template's families — Sora (display) + Outfit (sans), both variable
 * latin faces preloaded exactly like the pair they replace; Cairo keeps
 * its arabic role + the optional/preload:false D-01 decision. The
 * --font-sora / --font-outfit variables feed the @theme stacks. */

/**
 * ROOT SHELL (VERCEL-USAGE-3, 2026-09-21) — the former single dynamic
 * root layout (src/app/layout.tsx), now a STATIC component mounted by the
 * per-locale route-group root layouts:
 *
 *   src/app/(en)/layout.tsx  → <html lang="en" dir="ltr"> (ads on)
 *   src/app/(app)/layout.tsx → <html lang="en" dir="ltr"> (ads off —
 *                              the authenticated/admin surface, where the
 *                              Phase-139 ad-free law applies wholesale)
 *   src/app/(ar)/layout.tsx  → <html lang="ar" dir="rtl"> (ads on)
 *
 * WHY: the old layout resolved the locale from middleware headers()
 * (and cookies()) — which opted EVERY route on the site into dynamic
 * rendering (Next.js: dynamic APIs in a layout make the whole tree
 * dynamic). The production build confirms it: ~110 page routes render
 * per-request, so every crawler hit on every one of the 8,830×2 food
 * pages / 868×2 exercise pages / blog / tools invoked a serverless
 * function with full React SSR — the measured driver of the Fluid
 * Active CPU overage (4h33m/4h), the 498K function invocations, and a
 * large share of Fast Origin Transfer.
 *
 * The ONLY inputs this shell needs are properties of the URL subtree —
 * locale, direction, and whether the AdSense loader belongs there — so
 * they arrive as STATIC props and every page under the shell becomes
 * statically prerenderable (ISR exports on the pages finally apply).
 *
 * Per-route <head> resources moved DOWN to where they are statically
 * known (React 19 hoists <link> elements into <head> wherever they
 * render):
 *   - homepage hero preloads        → (en)/(home)/layout.tsx + (ar)/ar/(home)/layout.tsx
 *   - hub banner preloads           → the section layouts (blog, exercises,
 *                                     tools, foods, programs, memberships)
 *   - blog/exercises/referral preconnects → same places + referral page
 *
 * Lang/dir correctness is preserved EXACTLY: each group's root layout is
 * reached only by URLs of its own locale subtree (all Arabic routes live
 * under /ar/*), so no runtime resolution is needed anywhere.
