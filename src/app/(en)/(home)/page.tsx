/**
 * HOMEPAGE (EN canonical "/") — Phase 202 «Product-Website Homepage»
 * (owner order 2026-09-15: the homepage serves DISCOVERY + USAGE, not a
 * sales pitch).
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (Phase 202): this page is now a SERVER component — it
 * picks the curated REAL content samples (8 exercises / 8 foods / 3
 * programs) from the giant server-only libraries via getHomeSamples()
 * and passes the small serializable slices to the client LandingView.
 * The old "use client" page existed only for the OAuth-error toast,
 * which now lives in the tiny AuthErrorToast island below (verbatim
 * behavior).
 *
 * Metadata (canonical + hreflang cluster) is owned by this route
 * group's server layout.tsx — unchanged.
 *
 * SITE-CONTENT-281: the page additionally fetches the admin-editable
 * marketing-copy overrides (anon-key read + RLS public-read, migration
 * 0094) and passes them to LandingView. `revalidate = 300` is the SAME
 * ISR window the blog article pages use — an admin wording save goes
 * live within ~5 minutes WITHOUT a deploy, and a missing/failed fetch
 * renders the code defaults (the fallback law). The fetch converts this
 * page from fully-static to ISR (one regeneration per 5-min window at
 * most, the blog's accepted trade).
