            Diet Plan Library — Ready-Made Plans by Calories
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base font-normal leading-relaxed text-[var(--muted-foreground)]">
            This library turns your calorie number into an actual day of food:
            twenty-four ready plans, each built for one calorie level (from
            1200 to 3000) across four diet systems — balanced, high-protein,
            keto, and vegetarian. Every plan is written in grams and calories
            per item, with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack drawn from
            familiar, affordable food: eggs and pita bread, rice and chicken,
            lentils and yogurt — no powders, no ingredients your local market
            does not stock.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-base font-normal leading-relaxed text-[var(--muted-foreground)]">
            Start from your number: if you already know your daily calories,
            pick your system from the cards below, then your level from its
            calorie options; if you do not, run the calorie calculator first —
            a 1500-calorie plan fits a person burning 2400 very differently
            than one burning 1800. Then choose the system that resembles your
            life: balanced is the safe starting point for everyone,
            high-protein serves the fat-loss and muscle-building phases, keto
            suits people who already live that way, and vegetarian is built
            for days of legumes, grains, dairy, and eggs.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-base font-normal leading-relaxed text-[var(--muted-foreground)]">
            Every plan page ends with the customization step: plan your meals
            with AI — it generates a complete day from your number, system,
            and preferences, free without any account — or open the manual
            meal planner, enter the same items at your own grams, and watch
            the totals build live for each meal and for the day, then adjust
            the grams until your day lands exactly on your target. The ready
            plan opens the door; customization makes it your home.

            The weights in these plans are cooked or ready-to-eat — cooked
            rice is not dry rice, and a boiled egg weighs roughly with its
            shell. The plan is an honest starting scaffold, not a closed
            contract: swap an item for another from the same family (fish for
            chicken, lentils for chickpeas) as long as the daily total stays
            near your target, and measure your response on the scale across
            two weeks, not by feel. If your weight moved in the intended
            direction after two weeks, the plan is working; if it did not,
            adjust by 100 to 200 calories in the required direction and give
            the next two weeks the same patience.

            And the usual health reminder: these are general plans for healthy
            adults. If you live with a chronic condition — diabetes, kidney
            disease, pregnancy, or an eating disorder — the right number for
            you is set with a professional who sees your full file, and this
            library is an excellent conversation piece with them, never a
            replacement.
